A couple of weeks ago your Uncle Paul asked your Mum “What kind of personality does she have?”. We had to think about it for a while; as a baby you didn’t really do much except sleep and eat. Over the last month or so, coming up to your third month in this world, we began to notice something quite distinct. Your curiosity.

You’re never content to sit in one place too long. You don’t like getting cuddles when there’s something else going on – you want to turn around and face the action. You don’t seem to get upset unless your hungry, but you will grizzle when you get bored.

That curiosity is a fantastic gift, something we want to nurture.

Being curious means that you will always find new questions and seek new answers. You will always challenge the status quo and you will always search for a better way of doing things. Nothing is static in life and being curious means that you will move with it. It will open new doors, offer new experience and present you with meaning and connect you with people and places.

This universe is infinite and there is so much to see, learn, feel and experience. Always being curious means that you are open and accepting of the infinite.
