On Tuesday the 17th of April in the McDonalds in Yass you laughed for the first time with me. A big guffaw, giggles and squeals. It bought a tear to my eye and a big stupid grin to my face – I probably looked like the Joker. Unfortunately it wasn’t your first laugh, Great Uncle Stephen got that honour, but it is something that I will always treasure.

That smile is important, and being able to bring it out and show it to the world is something that will get you through everything in life. From the happiest and most joyful experiences to the most painful losses.

Never hide that smile. Never let it be to far away from you, it should always rest just beneath the surface. Never be afraid or ashamed to show it. Even in the worst possible moments in your life, that smile can help you and the person next to you get through that day.

It might just be a smirk, a grin, a quick glimpse, a cheeky look or a be big toothy grin.

Share that smile and share that joy!
